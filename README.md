# Week4-DS-IP
This is a data science project for week 4 Moringa school Independent projects. 
The project seeks to understand electric car usage over time by Autolib' which was an electric car sharing service which was inaugurated in Paris, France, in December 2011. It closed on 31 July 2018.

The main objective of this project is to dentify the most popular hour of the day for picking up a shared electric car (Bluecar) in the city of Paris over the month of April 2018.

We have used Pandas to do all the analysis.
